        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Takoyaki (たこ焼き, literally “grilled octopus”) is a dish made of wheat batter and filling, usually octopus or a similar type of seafood. Takoyaki is grilled in pans with small half-dome compartments and then flipped to give them their round shape, similar to the Danish aebleskiver.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dashi-flavored batter</li>
            <li>Octopus</li>
            <li>Beni shoga</li>

            <li>Tenkasu or Agedama</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Poach the octopus. 
                <p>This means you will submerge the octopus in a poaching liquid such as water or stock.</p> 
                <p>Poach for about 13 minutes per pound.</p>
                <p>Let the octopus cool in the poaching liquid.</p>
                <p>Once cool, remove the skin by rubbing it with a paper towel.</p>
                <p>It should come away easily.</p>
                <p>Sear the outside of the skinned octopus in a skillet or grill for about 8 minutes per side.</p> 
                <p>If sliced thin, only sear the octopus for 2 minutes per side.</p></li>
            <li>Chop up the cooked octopus, you will need to do this with a sharp knife on a cutting board, this recipe calls for 3.5-5 ounces of cooked octopus but this amount may vary according to your tastes.</li>
            <li>Grind some katsuobushi flakes, they will need to be ground into a fine consistency, this recipe uses about 1/4 cup of the flakes.</li>
            <li>Combine the dry ingredients of the recipe, these include: 1 cup of all purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of kombucha, and 1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>Whisk together 2 eggs and 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, make sure this is evenly whisked.</li>
            <li>Add the dashi stock slowly, a little at a time, whisk as you do so to make a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Heat the takoyaki pan on medium high heat, you want the outside to cook quickly, but not burn.</li>
            <li>Wait until you see smoke rising from the pan before adding the batter, fill the holes with the batter completely.</li>
            <li>Add the octopus, green onion, tenkatsu and powdered katsuobushi to the takoyaki.</li>
            <li>Set a three minute timer, during this time, the base of the takoyaki will brown.</li>
            <li>Break the connected batter between each bowl after the timer goes off.</li>
            <li>Set a timer for 4 minutes, during this time, turn the balls constantly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the takoyaki to a plate.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
