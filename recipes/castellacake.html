        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Japanese Castella Cake, or Kasutera (カステラ) in Japanese,<span style="background-color: #6D5D6E;">is a popular Japanese honey sponge cake</span> that was originally introduced by the Portuguese merchants to the Nagasaki area in the 16th century. The name is derived from Portuguese Pão de Castela, meaning “bread from Castile”.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Castella is made of just 4 basic ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300°F and prepare an 8 by 8 by 3 inch square pan lined with parchment paper. Also prepare some hot water and a pan or tray that's larger than the square pan for the water bath. *You can have the water bath already in the oven if you wish.*</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift in the cake flour to remove any clumps. Add the oil and melted butter and whisk until thoroughly combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the milk and mix until smooth. Then add the egg yolks and vanilla. Mix until well combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, add the egg whites and vinegar. Using a hand mixer, beat on medium high speed until the egg whites are foam, about a minute a two.</li>
            <li>Once the whites are foamy, add the sugar in small increments until all the sugar has been added. Decrease the speed to medium and continue to beat the egg whites until medium peak.</li>
            <li>Add a third of the meringue into the base batter and gently fold with a rubber spatula using a "J" motion to incorporate. Repeat two more times, with a third of the meringue at a time. Make sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl in between each addition.</li>
            <li>Pour the cake batter into the prepared square cake pan and gently shake it to level it out. Then firmly tap the pan on the counter to help pop any large bubbles.</li>
            <li>Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool for a moment. Then remove the cake from the pan by lifting the parchment. Carefully peel the parchment and cut the cake into your desired size</li>
            <li>Hot Taiwanese castella cake will be very jiggly but quite eggy as well. If you don't mind a bit of deflation, let the cake cool completely for best flavor. You can even chill it before serving.</li>
