    <h1>Ramen</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Simply put, ramen is a Japanese noodle soup, with a combination of a rich flavoured broth, one of a variety of types of noodle and a selection of meats or vegetables, often topped with a boiled egg.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Ramen noodles are made from four basic ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheat flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Kansui/かん水</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 2 ½ cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the soup base and vegetable mix. Boil for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the whole disc of dried noodles. Do not break the noodles in half. I know its fun to break stuff, but you must resist. Instead, slip the noodles into the boiling broth and press them down with chopsticks or a fork to keep them submerged. Don't stir the noodles—just keep them submerged. After 2 minutes, the noodles will soften and break apart.</li>
            <li>This is critical: I find that simply boiling the noodles for 4-5 minutes, as most ramen directions read, produces a limp and soggy noodle. To avoid this, you have to slow down the noodles cooking process while the broth continues to cook. The best way to do this: fan the noodles.</li>
            <li>Return the now-cooled noodles to the broth and add your toppings. Next week I'll go into the many, many ways to top instant ramen. For now, let's focus on the classic. Crack a raw egg over the noodles, cover the pot, and boil for 30 seconds. Turn off the heat, cover and let sit for 30 seconds more. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
